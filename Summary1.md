AGIS is an AI-powered blockchain security validation protocol that revolutionizes smart contract auditing. It combines advanced AI with crowdsourced expertise to detect vulnerabilities efficiently and accurately. AGIS specializes in detecting logical flaws and risks related to economic models, supporting various blockchain programming languages including Solidity, Rust, Move, Func, Go, Clarity and Cairo.
 
The platform streamlines the auditing process by allowing auditors and developers to publish or accept tasks to validate vulnerabilities and earn rewards. AGIS leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, knowledge matching, and scenario recognition principles based on large language models to mimic human auditors' thought processes.
 
AGIS incorporates a staking mechanism using its governance token, $AGIS, to prevent malicious behavior and ensure audit integrity. The system includes a reputation model, performance monitoring, and dispute resolution mechanisms. It offers tiered service plans and provides human assistance for disputes or doubts about audit results.
 
As part of the AgentLayer ecosystem, AGIS continues to refine its capabilities and expand its rule set. The platform aims to become a crucial tool in blockchain security, contributing to the development of more secure and reliable decentralized systems.
