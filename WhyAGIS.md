AGIS addresses key challenges in blockchain security:
1. High Cost and Slow Auditing: AI-powered efficiency streamlines the process, reducing time and expenses.
2. Vulnerability Detection Limitations: Specializes in identifying logical flaws and economic model risks using advanced AI.
3. Overwhelming Scan Results: Multi-layer verification and iterative optimization focus on critical vulnerabilities.
4. Lack of Comprehensive Solutions: Combines AI auditing with crowdsourced validation for a more complete security approach.
5. Developer-Auditor Communication: Facilitates collaboration through crowdsourced validation mechanisms.
6. Incentive Imbalance: Offers a fair compensation model, encouraging thorough vulnerability checks.
By tackling these issues, AGIS aims to revolutionize smart contract auditing, making it more efficient, accurate, and accessible for developers and auditors alike.
