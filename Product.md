AGIS application provides an interface for users, including developers, auditors, and bug hunters, to use the ability of AGIS that is based on LLM to detect kinds of logic vulnerabilities.
# Staking & Slashing
AGIS uses a staking mechanism with its $AGIS token to prevent malicious behavior and ensure audit integrity:
1. Stake Requirement: Auditors and validators must stake $AGIS tokens to participate.
2. Incentive Alignment: Staking encourages honest performance.
3. Consequences:
  - Failure to meet standards results in no rewards
  - Malicious behavior leads to partial loss of staked tokens.
# Reputation System
AGIS implements a reputation system for auditors and validators:
1. Performance Monitoring: Tracks accuracy, protocol adherence, and overall contributions.
2. Penalties: Imposes proportional penalties for malicious or negligent behavior, including partial or complete slashing of staked $AGIS tokens.
3. Reputation Model: Builds reputation based on performance and behavior. Higher reputation leads to task priority, while repeated misconduct may result in platform bans.
# Dispute Resolution
AGIS offers a dispute resolution mechanism for disagreements on audit findings or validator decisions. This process ensures fairness and transparency, potentially involving a third-party arbitrator when needed. The system aims to resolve issues efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the audit process.
# Rewards for Good Behavior
AGIS implements a positive reinforcement system alongside penalties:
1. Rewards for consistent good performance and positive contributions
2. Bonus $AGIS tokens for top performers
3. Increased opportunities for higher-stake tasks
This staking mechanism motivates auditors and validators to act in the platform's best interest, maintaining high security and trust standards within the ecosystem.
# $AGIS Utility:
1. Platform Fee: Users pay $AGIS for smart contract vulnerability scanning.
2. Task Publishing:
  - Users create audit tasks and allocate $AGIS rewards
  - Auditors and validators earn $AGIS for labeling scan results
  - Rewards based on accuracy and contribution value
  - Malicious actors risk $AGIS stake slashing
3. Staking Mechanism: Auditors and validators stake $AGIS to prevent malicious behavior.
4. Liquidity Incentives: Users providing $AGIS liquidity on DeFi protocols earn rewards, strengthening the ecosystem.
This model incentivizes participation, ensures fair compensation, and maintains ecosystem integrity through staking and rewards.
